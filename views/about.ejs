            At WoofWalk, we believe every dog deserves the chance to get out,
            get exercise, and have fun - even when their owners can't be there.
            That's why we've built a team of experienced, passionate dog walkers
            dedicated to providing the best possible care for the pups in our
            community.

            WoofWalk was founded by dog lovers who saw a need for reliable,
            personalized dog walking services in our local area. As pet owners
            ourselves, we know how difficult it can be to balance work, family,
            and other commitments while also ensuring our furry friends get the
            exercise and attention they need. That's why we created WoofWalk -
            to be the trusted, go-to resource for busy pet parents who want to
            make sure their dogs are happy and healthy.
